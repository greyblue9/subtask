Note about ".gadget" files
==========================

The "SubtaskGadget.gadget" file, as with any windows folder, is just a zipped version of all the contents of your gadget. So you could make another one by creating a zip containing all the files in SubtaskGadget.src, and then renaming the result from <something>.zip to <something>.gadget.

At least, that is what I recall... it has been 4 years...

Apparently there is a way to get Windows gadgets back in Windows 8,
using a program called "8GadgetPack" -- However I cannot guarantee
you it is in any way safe, reputable, or even displays the gadgets
true to their old Windows Vista selves. Well, and Windows 7 too,
but that was the beginning of the end of the Windows desktop gadget.
